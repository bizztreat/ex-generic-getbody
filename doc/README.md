# Extractor examples

The folder `examples` contains working examples different parts of Generic Extractor configuration. These are
configred against a mock API -- see the [documentation for running](https://developers.keboola.com/extend/generic-extractor/running/#running-examples).

Each example in the folder is referenced in the documentation - search for `[EX???]` where `???` is example number (e.g. `[EX090]`).
